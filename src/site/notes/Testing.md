Going to try and make seeds into admonition type boxes that can expand. Going to need some CSS magic for this.

Going with the info box for this one, the style could be global but I think I'll stick to page specific for now.
>[!info] Seed x
>Seed (Forest/Cave): `12344556789` / `321157419`
>Walrus Camps: 4
>Totally Normal Trees: 2
