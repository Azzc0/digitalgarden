# Pandoc stuffs
So I came across a post on the obsidian forums where someone was using pandoc, the eisvogel template and panrun to make nice documents within obsidian. I'm not sure what's going on on my end but I can't get it to work. The pandoc plugin isn't exactly very verbose.


Anyway. I did get a bit out of the post and managed to make a nice template for some future notes. I's not portable at all unfortunately but it's something.

I did not intend to make a blog thing out of the note garden but I guess anything is welcome at this point.
